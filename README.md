Jane Goodall, who did 60 years' research on wild chimps: 

> Work hard. Take advantage of opportunity, and never give up. You've got to really want to do this because there's a lot of competition and **it's hard to get money for research, so you'd better really be passionate about it**.  --interview in "science focus"  magazine, 2018.6, p57

## Note: 

Since 2017.11.1, I started my new career as a Data Analyst in Weathernew American Inc. I feel like I am entering a new world and pretty enjoy the position.

Anyway, career change is something easy to say than action. It is expensive in terms of time and money. But you have the **sole resposibility of your own career.** There is no one-size-for-all solution. Your mileage may vary. How you choose your career reflects what you value most and ultimately what kind of person you want to become. 

As a memo, the following factors have affected my decision to leave laser research:

1. Insufficient research funding since 2014.5.9.  However, I buried my head in the sand, and had a wishful thinking that a US Ph.D. degree will give me some magic power. 
2. I didn't have a clear goal for my reseach topic. In the first place, **asking the right question** is much important than getting the right answer. Of course, no one knows what exactly is the right question beforehand. But I shouldn't give up asking. **If I didn't do the important question, eventually I would waste my time/money**, e.g., clearing the mess left by a prior postdoc.  To get a good topic, you must be aware of it and **actively search for it**. If you are lucky, the supervisor would assgin a good topic to you. But putting your hope in luck is too risky.  Do yourself a favor to grasp your fate, OK?
3. Bad business model. In retrospect, I was too naive to believe that academic research in a Ivory Tower is a pure activity. I thought talking about money will distract us from the pure pursuit. **I was wrong at this point**. If you want something operates for a long time, you still need a business model, you still need to seriously consider where is the money coming from? What's the cost and benifit? Pure interest in research is only one of the many imporant ingredients. Research is expensive and it is not easy to last. **Only the market is the ultimate force**. Why consumer market is not interested in IC laser? Nanoplus sold an IC laser for 5000-8000 US dollars. What does an user expect to gain for such spending?  Detect methane? NASA is interested in buying one not only because NASA can afford it, but most importantly because NASA need to use this energy efficient device to detect CH4 on Mars at the **ppb** level (see page 9 of [my slide](https://github.com/jychstar/interband_cascade_laser/blob/master/ppt/Yuchao%2C%20Remix%20at%20the%20heart%20of%20a%20laser%2C2017_2_21.pptx)). But what on earth do you use an IC laser on earth? [Methane concentration in earth's atmosphere](https://wiki2.org/en/Atmospheric_methane) is over 1800 ppb. So, near-infrared laser is definitely a much cheaper solution. Seven months ago,  I was shocked when I learned that Hesai Photonics Technology Co. had already produced affordable [Laser-Based Remote Methane Leak Detector](http://www.hesaitech.com/en/faq/laser.html?backUrl=/drone-mounted_natural_gas_surveillance_system.html).
4. Emerging of data science and deep learning. From the perspective of big data, many scientific research are tiny data. The researchers spend a lot of time in producing the data: design experiment, tune a bunch of control variables, repeat each step, manually acquire the data, digitize the data). And then analyze the data and try to find a concise mathematical formula to represent the causal relation. There is a huge time cost in producing data. **Nevertheless, I more interested in producing insight from existing data**. With computing element cheaper and cheaper, and the data everywhere, there are huge opportunities to transform the real world.  With the breakthough of machine learning, we can automate lots of repetitive jobs and significantly improve human's productivities.

Nevertheless, it is still possible for me to come back when the time is right. **Deep in my heart, I still enjoy doing original research**, the "white box" style understanding -- that is the physics. The enlightening answers from nature sciene are always appealing to me.
