This repo stores my dissertation on IC lasers, cv and relevant research materials. My peer-reviewed papers can be found in [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=bRYWd5AAAAAJ&hl=en). 

Although I am not active in laser research, I still keep my pure interest in physics and algorithms.
