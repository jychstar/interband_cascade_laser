## Note: 

Since 2016.5, I was not active in laser research. 

On 2016.10.3, I made a tough decision to change my career. Around that time I was heavily involved in Udacity courses. A glimpse of what I did for the career move be caught through my [NanoDegreeProject repo](https://github.com/jychstar/NanoDegreeProject) and my blogspot.

Since 2017.11.1, I officially started my new career as a Data Analyst in Satellilte Meteorology. I am well-nourished in this position and bounce back from setbacks. I feel like I am entering a new world and would never turn back. 

As a memo, the following factors are why I left the IC laser research:

1. Research funding was cut since 2014.5.9. I only got one-week notice before the funding was completely cut. In retrospect, that is an early sign to warn me for a serious consideration of career change.  However, I buried my head in the sand, with a wishful thinking that a US Ph.D. degree will give me some magic power. Without other fincial source, an F1 Ph.D. candidate would live at the mercy of the P.I.

2. Wrong research topics/tastes/atmosphere. At the first place, **asking the right question** is much important than getting the right answer. Of course, no one knows what exactly is the right question beforehand. Then the hidden problem is whether the team leader is intentionlly foster a culture that tolerates any "stupid" questions. I was blamed by asking a "stupid" question and bullied by questioning the authority. **If I didn't do the important question, eventually I would waste my time/money**, e.g., clearing the mess left by a prior postdoc.  To get a good topic, you must be aware of it and actively search for it, not relied on the boss.  You need to be prepared to fail quickly and adjust goal/action at a fundamental/profound/subtle level. Wisdom doesn't come from random curiosity or an authoriy. It only comes from direct or indirect failures. That's also how machine learning works, in the philosophical sense.

3. Bad business model. In retrospect, I was too naive to believe that academic research in a Ivory Toweris a very pure activity. I thought talking about money will distract us from the pure pursuit. I was totally wrong at this point. If you want something operates for a long time, you still need a business model, you still need to seriously consider the cost and benifit. Pure interest in research is only one of the many imporant ingredients. Research is expensive and it is not easy to last. **Only the market is the ultimate force**. Why consumer market is not interested in IC laser? Nanoplus sold an IC laser for 5000-8000 US dollars. What does an user expect to gain for such spending?  Detect methane? NASA is interested in buying one not only because NASA can afford it, but most importantly because NASA need to use this low-power consumption device to detect CH4 on Mars at **ppb** level (see page 9 of [my slide](https://github.com/jychstar/interband_cascade_laser/blob/master/ppt/Yuchao%2C%20Remix%20at%20the%20heart%20of%20a%20laser%2C2017_2_21.pptx)). But what on earth do you use an IC laser on earth? [Methane concentration in earth's atmosphere](https://wiki2.org/en/Atmospheric_methane) is over 1800 ppb. So, near-infrared laser is definitely a much cheaper solution. Seven months ago,  I was shocked when I learned that Hesai Photonics Technology Co. had already produced affordable [Laser-Based Remote Methane Leak Detector](http://www.hesaitech.com/en/faq/laser.html?backUrl=/drone-mounted_natural_gas_surveillance_system.html).
